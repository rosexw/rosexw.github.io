###2018-practice

It's now deployed here: https://rosexw.github.io/css-hover-practice/index.html.

This repository is for me to practice CSS designs. In this project, I have created a sliding NavBar sliding from the left, on hover effect. When opened, the main content shifts to right, so it's not covered by it. However, the main part still can slide left to right and all excess parts will be covered by the NavBar.

Upon hover, the items in the main content will grow and have a shadow effect on the bottom.


To compile the Sass files, I used this command:
`sass --watch Styles/Main.scss:Styles/Main.css`
